            Hi everyone! My name is Aaron Huang and I'm an avid fan of the BEST sports anime out there, "HaikyÅ«!!". A couple reasons
            why I'm so passionate as to make a website about a couple of my favorite characters: first, I love volleyball. I haven't
            played volleyball my entire life (I wish I had) like some other lucky individuals, but the competitive and team nature of
            the sport really motivate me to constantly get better. That's why I'm a part of the UofM Men's Volleyball Team! Also, the
            characters featured in Haikyuu have very realistic character development in who they are as people, as well as their 
            technical volleyball skills. They're all really lovable people in general!
            
                <div>
                Just as a disclaimer to start, the characters that I have chosen to feature: Bokuto, Kuroo, and Nishinoya, may not be the
                literal best characters in Haikyuu, but they are my personal favorite. If you have other favorites please respect my choice!
                Some of the ways that I chose these characters over others was based on their technical volleyball skill, their character
                type, and their chaotic energy hehe. I hope you enjoy this exploration!
